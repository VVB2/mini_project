In it, the last Assyrian king, Sin-sharra-ishkun, appears to reach out to the Babylonian king Nabopolassar, recognizing the latter\u2019s rule and pleading to retain his own kingdom. The letter represents a great reversal in fortunes: despite frequent rebellions, Babylonia had for centuries been held under Assyrian rule, and at the beginning of his reign Sin-sharra-ishkun himself seems to have had some success in suppressing a rebellion there.By the time this letter was written the tide had turned, and, incredibly, Sin-sharra-ishkun repeatedly addresses Nabopolassar as the king my lord. We do not have the Babylonian king\u2019s answer in the form of a letter, but he must have rejected its terms: over the following years a coalition led by Babylonia and Media, a state in western Iran, destroyed the Assyrian capitals, and Nabopolassar, ruling from Babylon, came to inherit most of Assyria\u2019s former empire."

Matthew is often represented as a winged man, Mark as a winged lion, Luke as a winged ox, and John as an eagle, symbolism derived from the visionary imagery described by the prophet Ezekiel in the Old Testament (Ezekiel 1:4\u201311).The Evangelists were venerated not only as the writers of the Golspels but also as important patron saints. It is in the latter role, specifically as patron saints of the Republic of Venice, that the painted image of the winged Lion of Saint Mark appears on this late-sixteenth- or early-seventeenth-century helmet.Mark was an early follower of Jesus and is recorded as having accompanied both Saint Paul and Saint Peter on missions to spread Christianity in the Near East and Italy. He was most closely associated with Peter, the foremost disciple of Jesus, and is said to have served as his interpreter, translating his sermons from Hebrew into Greek and Latin."

It is a fully enclosing helmet with a pivoting visor and integral bevor.The two-piece construction of the helmet bowl, the scalloped edges of the plates, and the distinctive snub-nosed profile of the visor recall French helmets of about 1620\u201330. The reinforcing shot-proof plates screwed to either side of the bowl, which add 3 pounds 10 ounces (1675 g) to the overall weight, are rare on close-hlemets for cuirassiers. Beneath the reinforces, the original smooth blue-black surface of the bowl is preserved."

Fortunately preserved through the centuries by the dry climate of the coastal region where they were interred, the fabrics retain much of this complexity today. Textiles discovered in the necropolis of Wari Kayan on the Paracas Peninsula in the early part of the century are particularly striking. Encompassing a wide range of garment type, they exhibit rich colors imaginatively combined, and compelling designs and imagery. This fragment of a border from an embroidered mantle depicts two backbent figures that alternate position and share but do not alternate color schemes. Thought to represent the same skeletonized figure, they have been variously described as falling, floating, flying, dancing, and drowning."

Compositions are highly geometric and often illegible at first glance. Figures are distorted, compressed, expanded, and rotated until they reach the limits of abstraction. However, the woven figures ultimately refer to humans and animals known in the Wari iconographic corpus, such as staff-bearers, frontal and profile human heads, felines, and raptorial birds. This fragment shows four profile staff-bearing figures. Light brown figures with split eyes have a human aspect and the fangs of beings endowed with supernatural power. Green figures have the spots, muzzles, and claws of felines. All figures have wings, belts ending with stylized flowers, and appear as if they were running or knealing."

The Tiwanaku occupied the altiplano (high plain) directly south of Wari-populated areas around the same time, including territory now part of the modern country of Bolivia. The cultures not only developed and flourished as contemporaries, but also occupied adjacent lands for nearly four centuries. A Wari ceremonial center called Cerro Ba\u00fal was located a mere five miles from Tiwanaku-settled fields in the Moquegua Valley of Peru."

Salgo prized these works because most similar vessels are still part of ecclesiastical treasuries. Repairs to and replacements on this object were inevitable due to its age and the delicacy of the enamel and other fragile materials.The method of mounting recti-curvilinear enamel plaques seen here is particular to goldsmiths\u2019 work in Catalonia. The larger plaques represent the Betrayal, the Carrying of the Cross, and the Crucifixion. The heads stippled above the circular roundels are a fine example of this metalwork technique, which rarely was used in Spanish art."

The leaf shown here comes from a manuscript disassembled in the 1870s.These leaves trace the ancestry of Christ back through time to the beginning of the world.

Both offered opportunities to study the human form in movement and the play of light on the body, here emphasized by areas of dark shading in charcoal."

The flask - delicately carved from the rare stone material anhydrite - has the form of a pair of trussed ducklings placed back-to-back. Their necks arch far from the bodies and the joints of their legs make four little knuckles for the vessel to stad on. The birds' eyes are inlaid with copper. Trussed duck were a common offering to the dead. It is, therefore, possible that this vessel, although originally without doubt containing a cosmetic substance, was made for the tomb and not to be used in daily life. Vessels of this material were formerly thought to be of Middle Kingdom date. More recent studies have shown that they should be placed into the late Second Intermediate Period."

Finely carved ivory combs and knife handles produced toward the end of Egypt's prehistory demonstrate the high standards Egyptian artists had achieved, even before the Old Kingdom.This comb may have been part of the funeral equipment of an elite person who lived about 5,200 years ago. Parts of the comb's teeth, now missing, can be seen along the bottom edge. The detailed decoration suggests that it was a ceremonial object, not just an instrument for arranging the hair. On both sides are figures of animals in horizontal rows, a spatial organization familiar from later Egyptian art. The animals include elephants and snakes; wading birds and a giraffe; hyenas; cattle; and perhaps boars. Similar arrangements of these creatures on other carved ivory implements suggest that the arrangement and choice of animals were not haphazard. Elephants treading on snakes suggest that this part of the scene was symbolic."

Daddi fused Giotto\u2019s grandeur and monumentality with a refined grace and lyricism. It has been suggested that while Daddi was responsible for the design of this panel, it was executed by a leading member of his workshop. The panel is likely the upper half of an important altarpiece painted for a chapel in the Cathedral of Prato, near Florence, which houses the highly venerated girdle, or belt, of the Virgin Mary. As evidence of her Assumption, the Virgin lowers her girdle to St. Thomas, whose hands are visible at the panel\u2019s lower edge and who was depicted in the missing lower section of the painting."

The homely and naive figure types and the geometric simplification of the heads of the Virgin and angels reflect models the artist knew from his early training in the northern Netherlands. Already present is the characteristic combination of serene landscape, simple architectural setting, and meditative figures that would contribute to the painter\u2019s popularity."

The Crucifixion originally formed the altarpiece's central pinnacle while the Six Angels originally comprised pilasters. The altarpiece was probably painted for Santa Maria degli Angeli, the Camaldolese church of Florence, perhaps for the chapel founded in 1365 and dedicated to Ognissanti (All Saints), which was funded by Ser Francesco di Ser Berto degli Albizzi. The altarpiece and its components have been variously attributed to members of the renowned family of Florentine painters: the brothers Andrea (known as Orcagna), Nardo, and Jacopo di Cione. The commission may have been given to Nardo in 1365 and taken over by Jacopo, following Nardo's death in 1366. The Cione brothers, especially Nardo, were involved in multiple commissions for Santa Maria degli Angeli."

        "desc": "This work belongs to a series of tapestries designed to cover the walls of an entire room. Such sets were often referred to in medieval inventories as rooms. It is possible that this set was made for the French king Charles VII, whose colors were white, red, and green and one of whose emblems was the rose tree. A royal connection is certainly likely, for the tapestries are sumptuous, with metal threads not only in the clothing and jewelry worn by the fashionable courtiers and ladies, but also in the background leaves, buds, and open roses. Working from full-scale painted designs, the weavers produced tapestries like this by forcing the cross threads (weft) tightly into place\u2014each different-colored thread separately\u2014until all the undyed lengthwise threads (warp) were concealed.\nEven with several weavers working side by side\u2014the usual procedure\u2014and with the tapestries of a single set being worked simultaneously on separate looms, their production would have taken several years. Hung on the walls of a castle or manor house, tapestries not only served the practical function of insulation, preventing dampness from entering the room, but also constituted a visible and portable declaration of their owner's wealth and taste."
